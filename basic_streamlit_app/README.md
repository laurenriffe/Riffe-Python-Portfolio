Welcome to **Project Pet Finder**, an interactive and beginner-friendly web application built with Streamlit. This tool empowers users to explore, filter, and engage with real-world pet data through a simple, intuitive interface. Designed as a lightweight data product, this project demonstrates core data handling and front-end logic principles in Python. Whether you're new to coding or just love animals, this app offers an engaging, accessible learning experience.

## 🧠 Purpose & Learning Outcomes

This project was developed as a demonstration of how to:
- Build an interactive web application using Streamlit
- Read and display CSV data in a table format
- Apply dropdown-based filtering logic in real time
- Practice modular code organization and clean UI presentation

It is part of a broader portfolio focused on creating elegant, user-centered tools that bring data to life. Pet Finder reflects my interest in building approachable software with emotional resonance and practical utility.

## ⚙️ How to Run This App

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/laurenriffe/Riffe-Python-Portfolio.git
cd Riffe-Python-Portfolio/basic_streamlit_app
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
```
pip install streamlit pandas
```

### 3. Launch the Application
```
streamlit run app.py
```

You’ll see a clean, interactive dashboard where you can view, filter, and scroll through pet data based on size preferences.

## 💡 Example Use Case

**Scenario**: A user wants to adopt a medium-sized dog but doesn’t want to sort through dozens of listings manually.

1. Launch the app
2. Select `MED` from the dropdown filter
3. Instantly view pets tagged as medium-sized

This app simplifies the process and creates a joyful, useful digital experience.

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out
- ✅ Demonstrates **functional data filtering** and user interactivity
- ✅ Encourages **self-exploration** with datasets
- ✅ Built with a **clean, replicable structure** for beginners
- ✅ Embodies the value of **clear UI/UX even in simple tools**
- ✅ Showcases the ability to combine **technical execution with aesthetic charm**
