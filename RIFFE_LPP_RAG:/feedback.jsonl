THE SHAREHOLDER OWNERSHIP ARGUMENT FOR SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY\nMilton Friedman is a Nobel Prize-winning economist, but he obviously is not a lawyer.  A lawyer would know that the shareholders do not,  in  fact,  own  the  corporation.    Rather,  they  own  a  type  of  corporate security  commonly  called  “stock.”    As  owners  of  stock,  shareholders’ rights are quite limited.  For example, stockholders do not have the right to exercise control over the corporation’s assets.  The corporation’s board of director’s holds that right. Similarly, shareholders do not have any right to help themselves to the firm’s earnings; the only time they can receive any payment directly from the corporation’s coffers is when they receive a dividend, which occurs only when the directors decide to declare one.  As a  legal  matter,  shareholders  accordingly  enjoy  neither  direct  control  over the firm’s assets nor direct access to them.  Any influence they may have on  the  firm  is  indirect,  through  their  influence  on  the  board  of  directors. And  (as  Berle  himself  famously  argued)  in  a public  corporation  with widely dispersed shareownership, shareholder influence over the board is often so diluted as to be negligible.  Thus, while it perhaps is excusable to loosely describe a closely held firm with a single controlling shareholder as “owned”  by  that  shareholder,  it  is  misleading  to  use  the  language  of ownership  to  describe  the  relationship  between  a  public  firm  and  its shareholders.\n\nIn  conclusion, corporate governance can be seen as a balancing act between shareholders and other stakeholders. If a firm is performing well, its directors can opt to distribute profits as dividends, but they may choose to reinvest those earnings for future growth instead, which can indirectly benefit shareholders through increased stock prices. Thus, companies are not legally obligated to pay dividends, and the decision rests in the hands of the board of directors.", "mode": "CST Decision Framework (recommended)", "tone": "Neutral advisor", "strict_citations": true, "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "top_k": 10, "max_iter": 3, "similarity": {"avg": 0.5437280237674713, "min": 0.5172666907310486, "max": 0.6197829842567444}}
