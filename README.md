# 💼 Lauren Riffe's Python Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Lauren Riffe — a Finance major at the University of Notre Dame with minors in Computing & Digital Technologies and Theology (Class of 2026). This GitHub portfolio is a living archive of my academic and personal development in Python, data science, and digital tool-building. It reflects my belief that code should be not only functional but also meaningful — used to enhance lives, solve real problems, and build with intention.
