## How This Portfolio is Structured  
This portfolio showcases my data analysis and Python proficiency through multiple projects. The **Pet Finder Project** demonstrates my ability to build interactive web applications using Streamlit, while the **Tidy Data Project** highlights my skills in data cleaning, structuring, and visualization. Each project contributes to a well-rounded coding portfolio that reflects my growing expertise in Python programming and data analysis.


# Pet Finder Project  

## Project Overview  
The **Pet Finder Project** is a Streamlit-based web app designed to help users find their perfect pet by filtering available pets based on size. The application utilizes a dataset containing various pet attributes, making it easier to explore and compare different options.

## Instructions  
To run the project, follow these steps:  
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.  
2. Install the required dependencies using:  
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas
   ```  
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the Streamlit app with:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```  

## Dataset Description  
The dataset includes information on various pets, including their size, breed, and other characteristics. Users can filter pets based on their preferences to find the best match.

# Tidy Data Project  

## Project Overview  
The **Tidy Data Project** focuses on cleaning and visualizing data from the 2008 Olympics medalists dataset. The goal is to ensure the dataset adheres to tidy data principles by structuring it properlyâ€”each variable has its own column, each observation is in a separate row, and each data type is consistent. The project also includes visualizations to highlight key insights from the cleaned data.

## Instructions  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

You can install the required packages using:  
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Notebook  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd TidyData-Project
   ```
3. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python TidyData-Project.py
   ```

## Dataset Description  
- **Source:** The dataset contains information on medalists from the 2008 Olympics.  
- **Pre-processing Steps:**  
  - Data reshaping using the `melt()` function.  
  - Handling missing values by dropping them.  
  - Extracting relevant attributes (e.g., gender and sport) from column names.  
  - Cleaning column values for readability.  
  - Saving the cleaned dataset for further use.
