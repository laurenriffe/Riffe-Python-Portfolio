# 🏅 Welcome to the Tidy Data Olympics Project! 🏆  

# 📌 Project Overview

The Tidy Data Project 📊 focuses on cleaning and visualizing data from the 2008 Olympics medalists dataset 🏆. The goal is to ensure the dataset adheres to tidy data principles by structuring it properly—each variable has its own column, each observation is in a separate row, and each data type is consistent. The project also includes visualizations to highlight key insights from the cleaned data.
